README file for "The relative speed of the glucocorticoid stress response varies independently of scope and is predicted by environmental variability and longevity across birds." by Conor C Taff, John C Wingfield, and Maren N Vitousek.

The entire manuscript including all analyses and figures is produced with the markdown files and filtered data included in the repository. Three versions of markdown files are included that represent the initial preprint, revised preprint, and second revision. For the latest version of the manuscript and analyses use '3_md_revision2.rmd'. All code chunks are thoroughly annotated; please refer to these for descriptions of the analysis and data manipulation. Note that in many cases the models are large and were stored to save time. The saved model objects are not included in the repo because they are too large, but the full code to reproduce all included models is included in the code chunks.
